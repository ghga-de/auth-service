# Readme Generation

The Repository README is generated by collecting information from different sources as
outlined in the following.

- name: The full name of the package is derived from the remote origin Git repository.
- title: A title case representation of the name.
- shortname: An abbreviation of the full name. This is derived from the name mentioned
  in the [`../pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).
- summary: A short 1-2 sentence summary derived from the description in the
  [`../pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).
- version: The package version derived from the version specified in the
  [`../pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).
- description: A markdown-formatted description of the features and use cases of this
  service or package. Obtained from the [`./description.md`](./description.md).
- design_description: A markdown-formatted description of the overall architecture and
  design of the package. Obtained from the [`./design.md`](./design.md).
- config_description: A markdown-formatted description of all config parameters.
  This is autogenerated from the [`../config_schema.json`](../config_schema.json).
- openapi_doc: A markdown-formatted description of the HTTP API. This is autogenerated
  and links to the [`../openapi.yaml`](../openapi.yaml). If the openapi.yaml is not
  this documentation is empty.

The [`./readme_template.md`](./readme_template.md) serves as a template where the
above variable can be filled in using Pythons `string.Template` utility from the
standard library.

The [`../scripts/update_readme.py`](../scripts/update_readme.py) script can be used to
collect all information and fill it into the template to generate the README file.
